# Wage Gap (cont)

## Goal

I am either very smart or very naive — and I'm thinking I'm likely naive. I have attempted to combine my project for Big Data and Data Viz, and that means I'm making it more complicated to accomplish — but I only have one project to do. <br>
<br>
So in order to accomplish this, I'm thinking I will <br>
<br>

1. Ammend my static graphs so they are interactive
   I really, really want to push myself to use d3. Right now, I'm using altair because I'm planning on using a version of my static graphs. This draft is meant for me to learn from my peers what I can/should ammend in javascript that I couldn't do in altair. Do we like the way I'm labeling people's salary? Can I do interactives beyond tooltips?<br>
   <br>
2. Ammend the Big Data's app.js file and supplementary html files (in app_with_weather_form.zip in case you're curious) so it will <br>
   2a) Allow a user to input their name, salary, industry, sex
   2b) Have lines appear in graphs based on the the user's salary OR have their industry highlighted
   2c) To do more with the big data side, I'll have any user entered data go into the graph in field called "Web Users' Income" <br>
   <br>
   I've spent the past week just trying to understand the Big Data project. I am in for a rude awakening. Right now, these are my goals, and I'm a little nervous about them. I will live in JCL this week.

## Data Challenges

N/A -- already resolved <br>
<br>
There is fake data in the form a static line at $50,000 to represent what user data could look like. But that's in the process of being fixed.

## Walk Through

Super Rough Draft: https://uchicago.box.com/s/hfh0luk1kv2kr5jgdzf2uy1b0ud4amjy

Well, right now, I have essentially just added tooltips to my static visaulizations. There are titles and supplementary text missing. The positioning is off. But it's ... a base.

## Questions

... wish me luck
