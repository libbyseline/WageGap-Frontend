# Milestone 1

# Libby Seline

## Description
I would like to expand on my women's wage gap analysis and specifically focus in on the wage gap in the healthcare industry. 

## Technical Plan re: Option A/B/C/D

Scrollytelling with Option A, essentially. 

## Mockup

I would like to do a scrollytelling piece that leads to an interactive where people can learn more about industries they are curious about. <br>
<br>
Part 1: Scrollytelling <br>
<br>
This is an [example of a scrollytelling that I did not build](https://www.expressnews.com/expressnews.com/news/local/article/DWI-cases-San-Antonio-17577179.php?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=copy-url-link&utm_campaign=article-share&hash=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc25ld3MuY29tL2V4cHJlc3NuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvRFdJLWNhc2VzLVNhbi1BbnRvbmlvLTE3NTc3MTc5LnBocA%3D%3D&time=MTc2MjU3OTgzNzI5Mg%3D%3D&rid=MTcwNzU5Y2MtMDczZi00ZWE1LTlmZjEtYjI4NTJhNmJjNWFj&sharecount=MA%3D%3D), but I was involved in. I hope it can help demonstrate what I want to do. Since I'm using the same data, I could theoretically use the same images I produced for the static visuzliation in the scrollytelling. BUT that's just the first part of what I want to do. <br>
<br>
Part 2: Data Explorer <br>
<br>
[This is a very rough idea of what I want to do based off of a previous project with meh data viz](https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/where-new-san-antonio-residents-move-from-17029633.php?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=copy-url-link&utm_campaign=article-share&hash=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS93aGVyZS1uZXctc2FuLWFudG9uaW8tcmVzaWRlbnRzLW1vdmUtZnJvbS0xNzAyOTYzMy5waHA%3D&time=MTc2MjU4MDE0Mzc3MQ%3D%3D&rid=MTcwNzU5Y2MtMDczZi00ZWE1LTlmZjEtYjI4NTJhNmJjNWFj&sharecount=MQ%3D%3D). But I would like people to be able to click and explore what the data looks like in an area of an interest. I would still drive the narrative of women's wage gap in healthcare, but also allow people to dive deeper into the data on their own, be curious. 

## Data Sources

**INDNAICS CROSSWALK**
* Gives me the ability to match the industry with the INDNAICS code
* AI DISCLOSURE: I used AI to come up with an excel formula so I can clean up the column names in the .xlsx spreadsheet 

**IPUMS USA**
* 21 columns
* 6,538,604 rows

## Questions

In this moment ... I am thinking about combining this project with a project for my Big Data Class where we do need to use our data cluster to create a Big Data Web Application. I did have another idea for it, but this a nice way to tackle two birds with one stone. This is a very rough pitch, and I do need to look over the requirements for that project to ensure it would work. But in theory ... does that sound OK?
